## Problems 
- Take input from a user and check if the number exists in the array.
 ```

Input: 7
Output: Found in the position 3
Input: 9
Output: Found no element
 ```
- Input an amount from the user and find out the number of notes from input amount in given array.
```
Let 
The array is [1000,500,100,50,20,10,5,2,1]
Input: 1256
Output: 
1000 1
100 2
50 1
2 3
 ```


- Suppose, in a company , here are some employee salaries in an array.
